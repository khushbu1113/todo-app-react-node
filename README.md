React To-Do App
A full-stack To-Do List application built with React (front-end) and Node.js (back-end). This app allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It features user authentication for a personalized experience, and tasks are stored in a database for persistence.

Add Tasks: Create new tasks to keep track of your to-do items.
View Tasks: See all your tasks in a clean, organized list.
Edit Tasks: Update existing tasks when needed.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
Mark as Completed: Mark tasks as complete and unmark if needed.
User Authentication: Sign up and log in to manage your own tasks (optional feature).
Responsive Design: Works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
